The Boson framework
====================

The Boson Framework is a C++ library to write concurrent software in C++. The framework inspires freely from what the Go language did to address complexity in concurrent programming. The Boson Framework implements its own versions of three main Go features:

* The Go routines
* The net poller
* The channels

This project is currently a proof of concept. New features and performance improvements are to be expected in the near future.

The Boson Framework only supports Linux on x86-64 platforms for now, but Windows and Mac OS are in the roadmap.
